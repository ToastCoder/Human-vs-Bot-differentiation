## About:

This code differentiates if a user is a human or a bot based on various metrics. Implemented with TensorFlow.

The model is trained with some parameters which are helpful in identifying difference if a logged in user is human or a bot in train.py. The code in the file test.py collects various parameters from the user and predicts accordingly.

Model accuracy of 99% is achieved while testing.

## Supported Operating Systems:

Runs on Windows, macOS and Linux

## Tested with: 
1. Python 3.8.6 64-bit
2. TensorFlow 2.4.1
3. Pop OS 20.10
